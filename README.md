TypoType: Where Your Typing Skills Go to Die
What Fresh Hell Is This?
Welcome to KeyboardKaos, the typing test app deliberately engineered to make you question your life choices! Unlike those cozy, predictable typing tests that coddle you with consistent QWERTY layouts, we've decided that's WAY too easy.
Instead, we randomize your keyboard layout for EVERY. SINGLE. ATTEMPT. Because who doesn't love a dash of existential crisis with their WPM score?
Tech Stack (AKA Our Tower of Babel)
This monstrosity was cobbled together using:

Vue.js for the frontend (because we needed something to blame)
Python & Kotlin for the backend (yes, TWO languages, because picking one would've been too straightforward)

How It "Works" (Using That Term Loosely)

Start the test and be greeted by a completely randomized keyboard layout
Panic for a few seconds as you realize what's happening
Try desperately to figure out which key is which before the timer runs out
Get unceremoniously dumped to the scores page when time expires
Save your score (if you have any dignity left)

Critical Warning (We're Not Even Joking)
DO NOT PRESS ANY KEY AFTER YOUR TEST ENDS!
The app will immediately yeet you back to the start screen, obliterating your score data faster than you can say "why would anyone design it this way?" This isn't a bug, it's a feature to keep you on your toes. You're welcome.
