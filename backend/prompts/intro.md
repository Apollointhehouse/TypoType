The atmosphere was electric, but not the good kind, the kind that would tear your body in two leaving barely recognisable charred remains. Terrible people, with terrible ideas have gathered from far and wide, most from terrible places - Auckland, Hamilton, Whangarei and Rotorua to name a few.

Their leader laughs maniacally as they gather round the screen enjoying the theatre of terrible recordings - chaos, floods, Trump...

What terrible creations will be born during this malodorous weekend?
