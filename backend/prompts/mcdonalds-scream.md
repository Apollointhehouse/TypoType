A cacophony assaults your senses as you open the door entering McDonalds Greenlane. You second guess your decision to come here, but proceed onwards anyway. What is going on here? Is the deafening noise human, alien or robot?

As you round the counter and the self-service machines you see an middle aged man - balding, a stained white singlet - you regret not leaving when you had the chance. His heads snaps around to face your approach, his eyes focussed on yours. "You are next!" he shouts, only it doesn't come from his mouth - the sound erupts from a bass guitar he slammed with a drumstick.
