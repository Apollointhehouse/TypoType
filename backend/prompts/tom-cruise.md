A veritable gentleman, offering kind words and aid to all. He would garner a great deal of respect if his goodwill extended beyond his wallet. But the man we gaze upon only offers compliments to those that pay for them, only offers help to those whose cheques he cashes and uses trickery to manufacture a need for his approval.

And god, this is why you love him.
